## Lab 01: Setting Up the Development Environment
In this lab, we set up the development environment using the following tools:
- **Java**: Programming language used for the application.
- **IntelliJ**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for Java projects.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## Lab 02: Setting Up a Continuous Integration Workflow
In this lab, we established a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions to automate the build and testing of our application.
